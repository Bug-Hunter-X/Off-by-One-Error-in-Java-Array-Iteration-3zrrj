# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `BuggyArray.java` file contains code that attempts to populate an array, but due to an incorrect loop condition, it throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The corrected code is provided in `FixedArray.java`.
